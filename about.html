                                    Daytrading is the act of buying and selling a security within one trading day. Long term investing is buying a security and holding it for months, years or decades before selling.
                                </p>

                                    To be successful at daytrading you need to have a strategy that you will follow. These strategies include Impulse-Pullback-Consolidation Breakout, Reversal-Consolidation Breakout, Reversal at Support/Resistance and False Breakouts. These strategies can tell you what the market will do in the future with a high degree of accuracy.
                                </p>

                                    When daytrading not all of your trades will be profitable which is why you normally use a stop-loss. A stop-loss is a function that your broker usually will provide you with that lets you automatically close a position when a certain price is reached. A stop-loss is normally used in conjugation with a take-profit which essentially does the same thing but for the profit. I.e. open a trade at $1 set a stop-loss at $0.90 and a take profit at $1.20. Sometimes you might use just a trailing stop-loss which is a stop-loss set at a certain price under your opening price and will follow the market up but not down. I.e. start price $1.00 TSL (Trailing Stop-Loss) is $0.90 market goes up by $0.10 TSL is at $1.00 market goes down by $0.05 TSL is still at $1.00. Since the TSL only follows the market up it also acts as the take-profit as after the market goes up to its maximum and starts going back down it will be triggered and close the position at a profit.

                                    One of your big enemies when it comes to day trading is your emotions. The main problematic ones are Hope, Greed, Fear, and Regret. These 4 emotions will seriously damage your ability to profit from day trading if left unchecked.

                                    The differences between day trading and investing. Day trading requires technical analysis i.e. all of the lines on the charts and investing requires fundamental analysis which is when you look at  what the company or security is at its fundamentals. So day trading is more oriented towards reading the charts and investing is oriented at looking at the news relating to that security and acting accordingly. One other big difference is the commission of the brokers, for daytrading the trader makes way more trades than an investor therefore the fees are smaller for day traders and greater for an investor.
                                    <br/>
                                    Another big difference is the amount of capital. For daytrading it is required to have a large amount of money because you need to buy a lot of shares as you are making profits from very small market fluctuations. With investing the main tactic for the long term is dollar cost averaging where you put a set amount of money into a security every set period of time.
